DUAL LICENSING NOTICE
=====================

This repository contains two distinct components with different licenses:

1. GO BINDINGS (AGPL-3.0-or-later)
   --------------------------------
   The Go language bindings, wrapper code, and all Go source files in
   this repository are licensed under the GNU Affero General Public
   License version 3 or later (AGPL-3.0-or-later).

2. SWISS EPHEMERIS (AGPL OR PROFESSIONAL LICENSE)
   ----------------------------------------------
   The Swiss Ephemeris C library source code IS included directly in this
   repository in the `swisseph/` directory. The C source files are part
   of this repository and are compiled automatically by CGO.

   IMPORTANT: The combined work (Go bindings + Swiss Ephemeris) is
   subject to DUAL LICENSING:

   a) The Go bindings are licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later
   
   b) The Swiss Ephemeris library is available under TWO license options:

      Option 1: GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL-3.0-or-later)
      - For open source projects
      - When using the open source version, the entire combined work
        (Go bindings + Swiss Ephemeris) is licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later
      - This ensures full compatibility and compliance with Swiss Ephemeris
        licensing requirements
      - This is the default and recommended approach for open source projects

      Option 2: Swiss Ephemeris Professional License
      - Commercial license available from Astrodienst AG
      - Allows use in proprietary/commercial applications
      - Requires purchasing a license from Astrodienst AG
      - When using the professional version, the combined work is:
        * Go bindings: AGPL-3.0-or-later
        * Swiss Ephemeris: Professional License (proprietary)
        * Combined work: Subject to both licenses
      - Note: To use the Professional License, you must replace the
        Swiss Ephemeris source code in the `swisseph/` directory with
        the professionally licensed version from Astrodienst AG
